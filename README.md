This is a competetive dice game intended for 2+ players.
Each player will start off with a score of 0. Each member 
(starting with player 1) will have a chance to roll a 6 sided dice to
reach the desired max score. The person with the closest score wins, yay! 
But if your dice rolls a 1 you score is erased and your turn is over!!!!
